A webinos enabled collaborative projector
====================
Turn any device into a projector screen and show your images,videos or even youtube videos from any other device you may have.

### Description
This is a projector that is being controlled by multiple devices. User opens the application and selects projector mode to display multimedia content or controller mode to send the content (images, videos and youtube link). I have managed to see video in chrome, but this is a widget renderer limitation rather than an app flaw.
